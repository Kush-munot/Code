            <p>Hey, I am Kush Munot. A Front-end Developer and React Developer from India who
                    loves to design and code. I use React.js or Next.js to build the web
                    application interfaces and the functionalities. At the moment, I am
                    pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.<br /><br />
                    The first programming language I learned was C. Since then, I have also
                    learned Python. I also played around with databases, but Firebase is my
                    favorite right now.<br />
                    Aside from coding, I love reading books and cooking as well. I don't have
                    the time or really any interest in playing video games these days. However,
                    I also enjoy watching movies and web series whenever I have the chance.<br /><br />
                    If you were to ask me what stack I would prefer, I would say<br /><br />

                    - Framework - React.js, Typescript, TailwindCSS<br />
                    - Database - Firebase and MongoDB<br />
                    - UI Library - Material UI<br /><br />

                    You can do anything you can think of with these three things. I have done
                    two paid Internships into early stage Startups as Full Stack Developer.
                    I prefer making projects with my team and friends.<br /><br />
                    I love my work and enjoy each and every project as I get it. Feel free to look at my portfolio and don't hesitate to contact me.<br /><br /></p>
